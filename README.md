# GO PARCEL

GoParcel is a modern online platform designed to simplify parcel booking, management, and delivery. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), it delivers a seamless experience for customers, admins, and delivery personnel.

### For Customers

GoParcel makes booking parcels easy and convenient. Customers can sign up, input pickup and delivery addresses, and provide parcel details like size and weight. Real-time tracking and notifications ensure customers stay updated on their parcelâ€™s progress.

### For Admins

Admins have access to an intuitive dashboard for managing all operations. They can view bookings, assign delivery personnel, and monitor delivery statuses in real-time. The system also provides analytics and reporting tools to help optimize the overall process.

#### For Delivery Personnel

Delivery personnel can log in to their dedicated portal to receive assignments with detailed instructions. They can update parcel statuses (e.g., picked up, in transit, delivered), ensuring transparency for customers and admins.

GoParcel also includes secure payment integration, providing customers with multiple options to pay for delivery services. With its user-friendly design, robust functionality, and reliable performance, GoParcel is the perfect solution for hassle-free parcel management.
